<h3>Teen and Adult Karate Program</h3>
<small>Students 12 years old and up</small>

Teens and adults enjoy studying Karate because it is interesting and motivating. When you study Karate you will become stronger, more flexible, and much more confident in your ability to defend yourself, or others. There is more to Karate than most people realize. You will learn how to coordinate your body and mind. There is a feeling of inner strength that you will possess once you have confidence in your physical self-defense skills. You will feel less vulnerable, more in control, and free to express yourself without worrying about being intimidated or ridiculed. You develop the confidence to take on new challenges, to venture outside of your comfort zone, and to grow as a person.

Our program will help you stay in shape. You will gain flexibility through our stretching techniques which will decrease your chances of injury in sports and everyday life. You will build strength and tone your body with dynamic, isometric, and repetitive exercises. You will also gain confidence and self-esteem by improving your physical fitness, body composition, and skill level and self-defense skills.

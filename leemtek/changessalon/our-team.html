At Changes we are a team salon. This means you can feel comfortable seeing any one of our highly skilled professionals. Of course you can always request your favorite technician, but if they're not available, we'd like to make you aware of your options. This increases our ability to accommodate those clients who do not have the time to wait for a particular technician. Please feel free to use all of our talents, as your needs and busy schedule require.

Each member of Team Changes is a caring, dedicated individual with unique qualities to share. In a team structure such as Changes this contribution is represented by our motto “by helping others to be successful, I am successful!”

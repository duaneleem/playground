        <strong>Should I arrive early for my appointment?</strong>

        We encourage you to arrive 10 minutes prior to your appointment time so you can have a few moments to unwind. Starting your appointment on time allows you to receive the full benefit of your complete, unhurried service. If you arrive 15 – 30 minutes before your facial or massage appointment you are welcome to enjoy complimentary use of our steam room. You may want to relax in our Aqua Terra Room with 16 foot water wall or commune with nature in our Garden Courtyard.

        <strong>Can I use my cell phone in the spa?</strong>

        To maintain Changes Spa as an oasis of tranquility, please silence your cellular phone. If you need to make or receive a call your technician will escort you out of the spa.

        <strong>Can I bring my children to my appointment?</strong>

        For their safety and out of respect for other guests, children are welcome when scheduled for services only.

        <strong>Can I try a different technician for my regular service?</strong>

        If another staff members skills or schedule would better serve you, please don't hesitate to schedule with them. We are a team of professionals and we encourage you to try the work of all our specialists.

        <strong>Why do the prices say "from"?</strong>

        Some service prices vary based on the level of the technician performing the service and prices are subject to change. We avoid quoting prices for certain services that require a consultation to allow your technician to specify exactly which service is correct for you.

        <strong>Where should I park?</strong>

        Full day parking is available at the Broadway and Cypress parking garage. We do not recommend parking at meters, as enforcement is swift, and we cannot feed meters.

        <strong>What spa amenities do you have?</strong>

        Locker rooms with steam room, showers and styling aids are available. We regret we cannot be responsible for loss or damage to personal property, including clothing and accessories. Please keep all valuables with you during your appointment.

        <strong>What is your Cancellation/Rescheduling Policy?</strong>

Missed appointments or late cancellations will be billed at a minimum of $15 per service. We simply charge the low cancellation fee, whether it’s a spontaneous weekend out of town or the flu bug. Your card is not billed unless your vacated appointment goes unfilled. We do our best to fill these openings—just like you, we’d much prefer to have another guest take your place! Our cancellation fee is designed to provide partial compensation for our wonderful technicians, who rely on us to manage their schedule and their career.

		If you exercise your right to restrict processing, and if your exercise of said right is valid, then Warrior Trading can store your personal data but cannot otherwise process your personal data without your consent, unless otherwise processing your personal data is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the EU or a Member State.

			Where Warrior Trading’s processing of your personal information is necessary for legitimate interests pursued by Warrior Trading, you nevertheless have a right to object to Warrior Trading’s processing of your personal information on grounds relating to your particular situation. If you exercise this right, Warrior Trading cannot process your personal data unless Warrior Trading demonstrates that it has overriding legitimate grounds to process your personal data.

This means that you have a right to receive from Warrior Trading a copy of the personal data you provided to Warrior Trading in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. Additionally, this means that you have a right to require Warrior Trading to transmit directly to a third party the personal data you provided to Warrior Trading, provided that such transmission is technically feasible and provided further that such third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.</p>

Warrior Trading employs several safeguards to protect the transmission of your personal data. These safeguards include encryption of certain data and other commercially reasonable measures and practices. If you desire more information regarding these safeguards, then you should contact Warrior Trading using the contact information provided in Paragraph 1.</p>
		<p>Warrior Trading has not secured an Agency Decision from the European Commission that the safeguards it employs are adequate to protect your personal data.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Business purpose</span> means “the use of personal information for the business’s or a service provider’s operational purposes, or other notified purposes, provided that the use of personal information shall be reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the operational purpose for which the personal information was collected or processed or for another operational purpose that is compatible with the context in which the personal information was collected.”</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Commercial purpose</span> means “to advance a commercial or economic interest, such as by inducing another person to buy, rent, lease, join, subscribe to, provide, or exchange products, goods, property, information, or services, or enabling or effecting, directly or indirectly, a commercial transaction,” explicitly excluding engaging in protected free speech.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Verified Request</span> (or Verifiable Request) means a request that is made by a California resident on their own behalf, or on behalf of a California resident from whom they have received authorization, and that we can verify pursuant to its standard verification procedures.

<p><strong>Exceptions to Our Obligation to Provide or Delete Information</strong>.

This means that even if you submit a Verifiable Request, we are not required to provide information to you or delete your information if your information is required by us to provide any of the services we provide to consumers or clients. This will likely limit the amount of information you receive in response to a Verifiable Request under the CCPA.

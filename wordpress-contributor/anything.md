The following was done:
- Successfully went through Theme Check.
- Functions / Methods were unique.
- No deprecated calls.
- No debug errors/warnings.

FYI: Some issues that I've found you may need to be corrected:
- Spelling issues from several pages:
  - Appearance -> Customize: Setings should be "Settings"
  - real-estater-customizer.php several sections of "setings" should be "settings".

Just FYI on the misspellings and I know those won't affect the ability of the theme to be used.

Theme Check Results to correct on future update:

Warning: More than one text-domain is being used in this theme. This means the theme will not be compatible with WordPress.org language packs.
The domains found are real-estater, real-estater-pro

RECOMMENDED: No reference to add_editor_style() was found in the theme. It is recommended that the theme implement editor styling, so as to make the editor content match the resulting post output in the theme, for a better user experience.
